# Aurora Legacy: 2024 rules only (dnd-2024 branch)

This branch keeps only content for the **2024 rules (D&D 5.5e)**, so nothing written for the 2014 rules can end up on a 5.5e character:

* the shared `core/internal.xml` and `core/ALE.xml`;
* Player's Handbook (2024), Dungeon Master's Guide (2024), Monster Manual (2025);
* the monsters of the System Reference Document 5.2.1 (`core/system-reference-document-5.2.1`), the ones the Monster Manual (2025) file doesn't have. They include material from the SRD 5.2.1 by Wizards of the Coast LLC, available at https://www.dndbeyond.com/srd, licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode);
* the 2024 books from Aurora Legacy pull requests not merged upstream yet: Astarion's Book of Hungers and Netheril's Fall (#334), Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn and Adventures in Faerûn (#335), Lorwyn: First Light (#340), Eberron: Forge of the Artificer (#341), Arcana Unleashed and Arcana Unleashed: Deadfall (#354), Ravenloft: The Horrors Within (#355), with fixes for broken references.

# Aurora Legacy Project
The goal of Aurora Legacy is to continually support Aurora Builder app with updates to content files.  <br>
[Project's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/3n5uakXT2a "Project Discord Server"), where you can find the announcements, discuss relevant news and receive help with your homebrew files.  <br>
Please take a moment to review the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/AuroraLegacy/elements/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) when creating an issue, making a content request, or submitting a pull request.

## Extending Content
Go to the _Additional Content_ tab in Aurora, enter the URL of the index file, and have Aurora download the content to the custom folder for you. When these files get updated, Aurora will be able to keep content files up to date automatically.

<u>**Warning:**</u> Users who previously used content from now archived Aurora repository, must first delete following folders and files in "_custom_" folder (you can open it through the Additional Content tab's "Content Folder" button), before using links below: "core" folder, "_supplements_" folder, "_unearthed-arcana_" folder, "_core.index_" file, "_supplements.index_" file, "_unearthed-arcana.index_" file. <br/>
This also applies to users who want to change from Individual Indexes Download to All in One Download. <br/>
_**Additionally**_, old characters may require re-selecting some options, due to changes in new files (that includes errata, and general fixes).
